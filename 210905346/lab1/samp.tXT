Other possible values for oflags are documented in the open manual page, which you
can find in section 2 of the manual pages (use man 2 open).
open returns the new file descriptor (always a nonnegative integer) if successful, or â€“1 if
it fails, at which time open also sets the global variable errno to indicate the reason for
the failure. We look at errno more closely in a later section. The new file descriptor is
always the lowest-numbered unused descriptor, a feature that can be quite useful in
some circumstances.
